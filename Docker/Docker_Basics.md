# Docker

## What is Docker ?

- Docker is an open platform that enables users to develop, ship, and run applications with ease.
- Docker is a software platform that allows us to build, test and deploy applications quickly.
- Docker packages software inti stadardized units called as containers
- Docker can help us in easy deployment and scaling
- In a nutshell, Docker is a container management service
- The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

## What is a Dockerfile ?

- Dockerfile is a text file that has instructions for building Docker images.
- Once we build the dockerfile , docker image is created

## What is a Docker image ?

- Docker image is build from the docker file
- Docker images are read-only files and include several instructions that need to be executed to create a Docker container.
- Docker image is sharable and generally pushed on dockerhub in order to share with docker community

## Docker Container

- The running docker image is called as docker image
- Docker software is packaged as containers- a docker standardized unit. These containers have all the elements, such as system tools,   libraries, runtime, etc required by the software
- Containers are isolated from each other

## Features of Docker

- Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers
- With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA and Operations to work seamlessly across   applications.
- You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud.

## Components of Docker

- Docker Engine : It is used for building Docker images and creating Docker containers.
- Docker Hub : This is the registry which is used to host various Docker images
- Docker Compose : This is used to define applications using multiple Docker containers.
