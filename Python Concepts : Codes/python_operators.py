#Numerical operations in python
#Arithmatic Operators 
#  + for Addition
#  - for subtraction
#  * for multiplication
#  / for float division
#  // for integer division
# ** for power calculation
# % for modulus

# x = 5
# y = 3
# print("Addition : ", x+y)
# print("Subtraction : ", x-y)
# print("Multiplication : ", x*y)
# print("Float Diviison : ", x/y)
# print("Integer Divison : ", x//y)
# print("Power : ", x**y)
# print("Modules : ", x%y)

# # Operations ofn string
# str_data = "Akash"

# #Concat Operation
# full_name = str_data + " " + "Ghadge";
# print(full_name)

# # minus_str = "Akash" - "Akas"
# # print(minus_str)
# # It will not work as  - works with numeric data only

# new_str = "Akash" * 3
# print(new_str)


#Assignmnet Operators
#  =  -> x=5
# +=  -> x+=5  -> x = x + 5
# -=  -> x-=5  -> x = x - 5
# *=  -> x*=5  -> x = x * 5
# /=  -> x/=5  -> x = x / 5
# %=  -> x%=5  -> x = x % 5

#Compariosn Operators
# == -> equals to
# != -> not equals to
# >  -> Greate than
# <  -> Less Than
# >= -> Greater than equal to
# <= -> Less than equal to

a = 5

print("result of a > b : ", a > b)
print("result of a < b : ", a < b)
print("result of a >=b : ", a >= b)
print("result of a <=b : ", a <= b)

#Logical Operators
# and   ->   Returns true if both statements are true
# or    ->   Returns false if both statements are false
# not   ->   Reversers the results
